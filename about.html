    <body class="aboutme">
        again, my name is Maddy Van.<br><br>
        I'm an XR developer and designer.<br><br>
        I grew up in Owensboro, Kentucky.<br><br>
        My childhood as a avid gamer and reader led to coding and academic camps, 
        abandoning my hometown high school to attend the <a href="https://www.wku.edu/academy/">Gatton Academy of Mahematics and Science</a>, 
        where I dipped my feet into CS courses and AI research, 
        and finally a BS in Computer Science and Philosophy from Northeastern University in Boston, MA.<br><br>
