    <body class="aboutme">
        again, hi, i'm Maddy Van.<br><br>
        I'm an XR developer and designer. Cat lover. Occasional athlete, gamer, concert-goer, movie watcher and book reader.<br><br>
        I grew up in Owensboro, Kentucky.<br><br>
        My childhood as a avid gamer and reader led to coding and academic camps, 
        abandoning my hometown high school to attend the <a href="https://www.wku.edu/academy/" title="Read about the Gatton Academy on their page.">Gatton Academy of Mahematics and Science</a>, 
        where I dipped my feet into CS courses and AI research, 
        and finally a BS in Computer Science and Philosophy from Northeastern University in Boston, MA, 
        during which I did a 6-month co-op at SimpliSafe as a mobile app developer (iOS). 
        Through our school's VR club, I became an undergraduate research assistant doing XR Content Development creating
        augmented reality learning simulations for the US Navy Cold Spray & Paint Booth machines using the HoloLens 2.<br><br>
